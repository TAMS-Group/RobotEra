-new Navigation (DGPS)

WP9 Breakthroughs and Exploitation (Sebastian)
-Information will be provided for free in future
-what people will be paying for is mobility

WP10 Dissemination
-repository website
-LinkedIn, Facebook Group (question: IP??)
-all publications need to have the 'grant agreement' text on it (see WP10 slide)

    -exchange of bag with robot-outdoor
    -planning the way from the condominium door to flat
    -navigation avoiding obstacles
    -taking the lifter
    -exchange of bag with robot-domestic
 - Robot-Domestic
    -localization inside home
    -recognition of presence of Robot-Condominium
    -eschange of bag with Robot-Condominium
    -Planning the way from the door to kitchen

Scenario 2
- on christmas it is cold and old man is at home alone with flu
- his chidlren are spending christmas with theis spouses' families

refinement of services/scenarios for experiments

Afternoon Discussion:
=====================
-Örebro (Federico)
  -'Tupleview' - Middleware
  -Is this AmI? or Peis?
  -Symbolic levels (Interface to Robot)- Interface!!
  -UDP - publish, subscribe
  -Interface : Behaviors
    questions: Temporal aspect
    - Blackboard architecture (basically) with timestamps
    what information are suitable (abstract enough)
    -Objects level
