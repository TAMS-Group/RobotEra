 Afternoon discussion (WP4,5,6) in room 4:
 -What MetraLabs does need from UHAM
 -Simulation of Environment (ORU,SSSA) /Robot (ML)
 -When to get robot at UHAM
 -Input from WP2/INCRA (Cover, Gripper, Handle etc) when, how?
 -Deliverable in month 5: HW + SW specifications (ML), how is it working
  ML: Schunk Catalog: see the website (??)
  -Schunk has some ROS stack for arms (ethernet)

 Summary:
 -get simulator from MetraLab
 -get Catalog from MetraLab (Hardware)
 -some ROS interface (platfrom/arms)
 -need payload for gripper/arm (0.5 or 10kg)
 -make a list to ML

Deliverable 4.1:
  -Middleware architecture (PEIS)
  -Hardwarearchitecture
  -manipulation/grasping/navigation

Suggestion:
 -do meeting minutes next time ('tighten pad', 'pirate pad')
 -next (remote) meeting in March (6/7 March 2012, 6pm) 9 March 10am
